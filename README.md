renderer
========

Just making a OpenGL, OpenGLES and DX renderer for some fun and experiments.

Works on Win 7, OSX and Web (via emscripten).

If you're interested in running this application, you must ensure that your
working directory is the root directory of the repo, and the src folder is 
under your include directories (this usually works first go on xcode, but
visual studio seems to have some problems even between fresh installs.. weird)
