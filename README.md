renderer
========

Just making a OpenGL, OpenGLES and DX renderer for some fun and experiments.

This is definitely not meant to be a pretty application, nor a complete piece
of software showing off my wonderful skills (sarcasm). It's a playground I use for 
breaking things, experimenting and learning in my spare time.

Works on Win 7, OSX and Web (via emscripten).

If you're interested in running this application, you must ensure that your
working directory is the root directory of the repo, and the src folder is 
under your include directories (this usually works first go on xcode, but
visual studio seems to have some problems even between fresh installs.. weird)

Requires SDL2, Emscripten and Boost
